# _Heart-Disease-Predict_

_**Overview :**_ Developed a machine learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on user-provided medical data. The application allows users to enter personal information and medical parameters and then visualizes the analysis results through interactive graphs.

_**Key Features :**_

**User Input :** The application collects essential user data, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators through a user-friendly GUI.

**Data Visualization :** Interactive graphs display critical parameters, enabling users to understand their health metrics better.

**Prediction Model :** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the input data and predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

**Information Section :** Provides detailed descriptions of each medical parameter, helping users understand the importance of the data they enter.

**Data Storage :** The application can save user inputs and predictions to a MySQL database for future reference.

_**Technology Stack**_

_**Programming Language :**_ Python
_**Libraries :**_ Tkinter for GUI, Scikit-learn for machine learning, Matplotlib for data visualization, and MySQL for data storage.
